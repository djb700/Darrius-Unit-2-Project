                <h2>Climate change</h2>
                <!--Add text, images, and links for section 1 below!-->
                <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Climate change is so most of us have heard of but for a recap. Climate change is saying that all the greenhouse gasses are breaking the ozone layer and are causing the world to get hotter.</p>

                <img alt="diagram where theres four steps.
step 1.CFC released into environment by industries, rise up to stratosphere.
step 2.Sunlight breaks CFCs up,releasing Chlorine.
step 3.Chlorine reacts with Ozone 03, and destroys Ozone.
step 4.More reaction cause more depletion.

                <p style="text-indent: 25px;">this is one of the more likely we all die since we all use the products that are made with these industries. For example, the underwear you are hopefully wearing most likely says it is made in China. Most of China's industries are factories that produce greenhouse gasses. Including what was used to make your underwear.</p>
